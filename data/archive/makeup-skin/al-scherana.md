A easy to understand walk through on editing your skin texture and tattoos with glow. This doesn't cover making the alpha yourself or making a glow enabled tattoo do the thing, just editing tattoos that already have glow functionality, like adding scales to your skin. Basically you'll need a psd that has the glow enabled.
