A generous and very <sup>not</sup> permanent guide on setting up for the initial stages of modding in Dawntrail and a few issues you might com across during the process of getting everything working. He intends to delete it once things are stabilized but i figured it could be useful for people who wont be updating their textools and stuff for a bit (7/10/24 it was deleted, link replaced with my archived copy.)
