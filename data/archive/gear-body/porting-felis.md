Learn to rip from Blade and Soul with Felis. Technically this guide is incomplete as it intends to follow the entire process from start to finish. But it serves as a Ripping Guide for BnS for now. Those with experience in creating Mods or porting could follow from here to finish it themselves. Will update this desc as needed.
